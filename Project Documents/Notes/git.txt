Clone a repository
git clone <git_url>

git status

To ignore unwanted binary files from being tracked by git, place a .gitignore file in the root folder with atleast the following contents:
*.pot
*.pyc
*.py[co]
__pycache__

In case the .gitignore file is added after a few commits, use the following command to remove tracked files
git rm --cached -r *

Thereafter, add files again, commit and push.
